# Dog Breed Classification

Introduction
---
This project aims to classify different breeds of dogs using machine-learning techniques. The dataset consists of images of various dog breeds, and the objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the breed of a dog based on its image.

Dataset
---
The dataset used in this project contains images of dogs along with their corresponding breed labels. It includes the following 

**key features:**
- ID: Unique identifier for each image.
- Platform: Platform where the image was sourced from (not relevant for classification).
- Sentiment: Sentiment associated with the image (not relevant for classification).
- Text: Description or caption of the image (not relevant for classification).
- Breed: Breed label of the dog in the image.

Data Preprocessing
---
- Label Encoding: The breed labels are encoded numerically using label encoding.
- Image Preprocessing: Images are resized to a fixed size (128x128) and normalized to ensure consistency and facilitate model training.
- Data Augmentation: Data augmentation techniques such as vertical flip, horizontal flip, dropout, gamma adjustment, and brightness/contrast adjustment are applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve model generalization.

Model Architecture
---
- Transfer Learning: InceptionV3 pre-trained on ImageNet is used as the base model for feature extraction.
- Fine-tuning: The base model's layers are frozen, and additional fully connected layers are added on top for classification.
- Output Layer: A softmax output layer with 120 units (corresponding to the number of dog breeds) is used to predict the probability distribution over the classes.

Training
---
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used with a categorical cross-entropy loss function.
- Callbacks: Early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks are employed to prevent overfitting and improve training efficiency.
- Metrics: Model performance is evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC) metric, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between different classes.

Results
==
- Model Performance: The model achieves high accuracy and AUC score on the validation dataset, indicating its effectiveness in classifying dog breeds.
- Training History: The loss and AUC curves are plotted to visualize the training and validation performance over epochs.

Conclusion
==
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for dog breed classification based on image data. By leveraging transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-tuning strategies, it is possible to develop accurate and robust models for solving classification tasks in computer vision.
